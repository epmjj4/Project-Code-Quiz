I created the following files: an index.html file, a scores.html file, a logic.js file, a questions.js file, and a scores.js file. 

In the index.html file, in first section I setup an href to be able to toggle back and forth from scores.html file. I set the id's for time and scoreCounter, so that each each displayed on the page. The next section has an id of beginQuiz with the start button. The following Div has the form with radio buttons so that user can select their answers. Underneath taht, I set two H3 tags to use msg and finalScore id's. The div with id playerName will capture users input to save their score. 

In the scores.html I set up an href so user can toggle back to index.html home page and a clear button to clear the user info.

In the style.css file, I add a background color to the body on the html files and styled the buttons. 

In the logic.js file, I set up the variables for the choices and the answers as well as variable for start button, all the id's that are assigned to the form and score count variables.
